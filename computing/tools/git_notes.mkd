#Clients
Has potential:
- TortoiseGit - have git-svn, windows only
- GitEye - by the folks who wrote svn, but doesn't seem to have git-svn support built in. Eclipse based. Multiplatform. Mandatory reg after 30d
Hopeless:
- SmartGit - need to pay for commercial use
- SourceTree - Has gone downhill a lot after lead developer quits, super slow on windows. Mandatory reg to Atlassian.
- Gitkraken - Very new. Mandatory reg. Electron javascript based, so super bloated.

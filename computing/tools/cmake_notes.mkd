Specifying out of tree build:

You can use the undocumented CMake options -H and -B to specify the source and binary directory upon invoking cmake:
`cmake -H. -Bbuild -G "MSYS Makefiles"`
This will look for the CMakeLists.txt in the current folder and create a build folder (if it does not yet exist) in it.
